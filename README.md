## STAR WARS RPG

This is the Star Wars RPG I made.  You start by selecting a character, then selecting a character to attack. When you attack a character. The damage you did and the damage they did appear on the sidebar console.  

Your attack increases every time you attack. 

You want to start by attacking enemies with a smaller counter attack, so you can get your attack up.  

The amount of HP a character has does not necessarily represent how powerful their attack and counter attack is. 

For instance. Obi Wan has low HP, but a very high counter attack. Attacking him first could go very badly for your character.
